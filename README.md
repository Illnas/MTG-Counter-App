### Notes
This project was created for purpose of practicing Redux (not a Toolkit version). As such,
this project code has a lot of different coding practices. Just take one look at the state managment of PlayerOne 
state. Not only was this practice project for Redux, but TypeScript will be integrated only after project was finished. In that way I will practice 
integrating TypeScript into already finished project, and go over Redux again.
