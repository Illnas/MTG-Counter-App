MTG Counters 

Decided it's time to practice Redux and TailwindCSS and just when I needed an idea for project, I had a Magic the Gathering game with my brother. With that
game I soon realized that there is a need to count lifepoints, counters, tokens and 
many other things which is why I am making this project.
